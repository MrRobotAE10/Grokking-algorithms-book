1. Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?

    > The maximun number of steps it would take in a sorted list of 128 names would be: log_2 (128) = 7 steps (rounded)

2. Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now?

    > Size of the list now = 256\
    > The maximun number of steps it would take in a sorted list of 256 names would be: log_2 (256) = 8 steps (rounded)
