1. Suppose you can steal another item: an MP3 player. It weighs 1 lb and is worth $1,000. Should you steal it?

    > Yes. Then I can steal the phone and the guitar

2. Suppose you’re going camping. You have a knapsack that will hold 6 lb, and you can take the following items. Each has a value, and the

 Water, 3 lb, 10

 Book, 1 lb, 3 

 Food, 2 lb, 9 

 Jacket, 2 lb, 5

 Camera, 1 lb, 6

 What’s the optimal set of items to take on your camping trip?
