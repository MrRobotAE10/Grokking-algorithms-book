1. Write the code for the sum function

    > sum.py

2. Write a recursive function to count the number of items in a list.

    > counter.py

3. Find the maximum number in a list

    > maximum.py

4. Remember binary search from chapter 1? Itâ€™s a divide-and-conquer algorithm, too. Can you come up with the base case and recursive
case for binary search?

    > Base case: An array with one item, Recursive case: Splitting the array in half

How long would each of these operations take in Big O notation?

5. Printing the value of each element in an array.

    > O(n)

6. Doubling the value of each element in an array.

    > O(n)

7. Doubling the value of just the first element in an array.

    > O(1)

8. Creating a multiplication table with all the elements in the array. So if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first multiply every element by 2,
then multiply every element by 3, then by 7, and so on.

    > O(n^2) Because for each element in the arr, it multiplies by every other element
