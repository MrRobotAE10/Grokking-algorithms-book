1. You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All
the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize
space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?

    > Pick the largest box and fit in the available space. It doesn't give the optimal solution

2. You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want to see it) 
and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your
stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?
