1. Write the code for the sum function

    > sum.py

2. Write a recursive function to count the number of items in a list.

    > counter.py

3. Find the maximum number in a list

    > maximum.py

4. Remember binary search from chapter 1? Itâ€™s a divide-and-conquer algorithm, too. Can you come up with the base case and recursive
case for binary search?

How long would each of these operations take in Big O notation?

5. Printing the value of each element in an array.

6. Doubling the value of each element in an array.

7. Doubling the value of just the first element in an array.

8. Creating a multiplication table with all the elements in the array. So if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first multiply every element by 2,
then multiply every element by 3, then by 7, and so on.
